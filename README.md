**Troubleshooting Bootstrap Cards**

The curent vertion of Bootstrap as of ***Saterday July 10, 2021*** has some kind of bug in it when it comes to Cards so I have provided an old vertion of `React-Bootstrap` in the file named "bootstrap" 
- Simply replace the bootstrap file in node_modules with the one provided.
